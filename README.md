# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 

Who Wants to be a Millionaire implemented in Java using Swing.

## About

This project was a semester long assignment for COMP603 Program Design and Construction in semester 1 of 2017 at Auckland University
of Technology.
 
The brief was to make a game using Java. I chose to do Who Wants to Be a Millionaire based on the UK version of the show. 
There were two submissions for this assignment. The first required the game to be implemented as a CLI and the second as
a GUI. This repo is that second submission.

The project is slightly modified to remove game sounds as I'm not sure of the copyright status of them.

The game had to run without any configuration on the markers side hence no build system. This is also the reason to include
the fully setup and populated embedded derby database.
